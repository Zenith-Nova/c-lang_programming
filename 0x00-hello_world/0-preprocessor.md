# Task:

- A script that runs file through the preprocessor and save the result into another file

- **TODO:**
  1. File name is saved the variable `$CFILE`
  2. output is should be saved in the file `c`

# Solution:

> **create the** _0-preprocessor_ file

1. export the variable system wide
   ```bash
    export CFILE=main.c
   ```
2. change permission:
   ```bash
       chmod a+x 0-preprocessor
   ```
3. execute the script
   ```bash
        ./0-prprocessor
   ```
