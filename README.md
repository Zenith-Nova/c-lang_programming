# Low-Level Programming in C Learning Repository

## Overview

Welcome to my Low-Level Programming in C Learning Repository! This repository is a personal space where I document and practice my journey into low-level programming using the C programming language. Whether you are new to low-level programming or looking to strengthen your skills, join me in exploring the fundamentals and intricacies of C.

## Introduction

As a learner in the realm of low-level programming, this repository serves as my learning journal. I aim to understand the underlying concepts, master practical skills, and build a solid foundation in C programming. Feel free to explore my progress, examples, and exercises.

## Getting Started

If you're also interested in low-level programming with C, consider forking this repository and cloning it to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/low-level-c-learning.git
cd low-level-c-learning
```
Make sure you have a C compiler installed (e.g., GCC or Clang) to experiment with the examples and exercises.

Install GCC on macOS
```
brew install gcc
```
Install GCC on Windows (using MinGW)
-  Download and follow the installation instructions from [https://mingw-w64.org](https://mingw-w64.org)
<!--
## Topics Covered

My learning journey covers various low-level programming topics, including:

- Memory Management
- Pointers and Arrays
- Bit Manipulation
- File I/O
- System Calls
- Assembly Language (x86 or ARM, depending on the platform)

## Examples

The `examples` directory contains code snippets and small programs illustrating different low-level programming concepts. Each example is commented to explain the underlying principles.

## Exercises

The `exercises` directory provides hands-on exercises to reinforce my understanding. Feel free to attempt these exercises and compare solutions.

## Progress

Check the [Progress](PROGRESS.md) file to see my learning milestones, challenges, and achievements.

## Acknowledgments

I would like to express my gratitude to the online programming community, educational resources, and mentors who have inspired and guided me on this learning journey.
